\description{
A dataset containing pseudo-quadrat data for NVC
communities generated by random sampling from NVC species
list. The psuedo-quadrat data comes from a study by Tipping \emph{et al.} 2013.
}
\details{
When generating psudeo-quadrants the  probabilities
of species being in a sample were set to match the
constancy scores of the species in that given NVC
community/sub-community. The probabilities associated
with each constancy score were 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for
constancy scores 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The number
of psuedo-quadrats generated for each NVC community or
sub-community was set to match the number of samples originally
used to define the NVC and produce the contingency tables.
